	/ What kind of information can uniquely identify you?

		- Full names 
		- Usernames, Email..
		- Physical identifiers: Skin color, hair color, fingerprints


	/ Requirements on identification:

		- Each value should be unique for user accountability
		- The value should not be shared
		- A standard naming scheme should be followed 
		- The value should be nondescriptive of the userÂ´s position or tasks
	
	/ Authentication 

		User Authentication
		
		A process that vertify the "Binding" between an claimed entity with some
		attributes/information, such as;
			
			- Password, PIN, Security Token, Biometric Information that can 
			  not be provided by others 
			- User authentication is primary line of defense in computer security;
			- Other security controls rely on user authentication (can we have a 100% correct process)
 	
	/ Means of Authentication
		
		Something the induvidual;

		Knows
		- Etc: Passwod, PIN, Sec Questions
		
		Prossesses
		- Tokens: Keycard, Smart Card, Physical keys
		
		Is
		- Static biometrics: Fingerprints, Retina, Face

		Does
		- Dynamic Biometrics: Voice Pattern, Handwrigting, typing rhythm

	/ Password-based Authentication
		
		- How to store passowrds?
		- How to select passwords?
		- How to submit the passwords?
		- How to respond (if no match)?
		
		Storing Passwords in the Clear Text
			- Insider attack: normal user reads the database and learns other users passowords

	/ Storing passwords in the Hashed Text
		
		- Hashes of passwords are stored
		- When user submits password, it is hashed and compared to the stored value
		-		

	/ Hash value
		
		if a hash with 16 bits is chosen
		
		PWD1		HASH1
		---------------------
		etc		etc
		
		PWD1^12		HASH1^12
			
	/ Cracking Passwords 
		
		Known Technical Attacs
		
		/ Brute Force Attack
			
			- B
		
		TOTAL TIME = PASSWORD SPACE / SPEED
